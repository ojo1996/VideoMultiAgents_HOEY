Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Equations:**\n   - The first equation \\( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \\) represents a circle in the complex plane centered at \\( 25 + 20i \\) with radius 5.\n   - The second equation \\( |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \\) represents the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the points \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Finding the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n   - The midpoint of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is \\( \\frac{(4 + k) + (3i + k)}{2} = 2 + \\frac{3i}{2} + k \\).\n   - The slope of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is \\( \\frac{3 - 4}{0} = \\infty \\), so the perpendicular bisector is a horizontal line passing through \\( 2 + \\frac{3i}{2} + k \\). Thus, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Intersection of the Circle and the Line:**\n   - For the system to have exactly one solution, the circle must be tangent to the line. The distance from the center of the circle \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\) must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 5.\n   - The distance from the point \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is \\( |20 - \\frac{3}{2}| = \\frac{37}{2} \\). Since this distance must be equal to 5, we have \\( \\frac{37}{2} = 5 \\), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the line is shifted horizontally by \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Finding the Possible Values of \\( k \\):**\n   - The distance from the center of the circle \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} + k \\) must be equal to 5. This gives us \\( |20 - \\frac{3}{2} - k| = 5 \\).

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Equations:**\n   - The first equation \\( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \\) represents a circle in the complex plane centered at \\( 25 + 20i \\) with radius 5.\n   - The second equation \\( |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \\) represents the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the points \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Finding the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n   - The midpoint of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is \\( \\frac{(4 + k) + (3i + k)}{2} = 2 + \\frac{3i}{2} + k \\).\n   - The slope of the line segment joining \\( 4 + k \\) and \\( 3i + k \\) is \\( \\frac{3 - 4}{0} = \\infty \\), so the perpendicular bisector is a horizontal line passing through \\( 2 + \\frac{3i}{2} + k \\). Thus, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Intersection of the Circle and the Line:**\n   - For the system to have exactly one solution, the circle must be tangent to the line. The distance from the center of the circle \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\) must be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 5.\n   - The distance from the point \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} \\) is \\( |20 - \\frac{3}{2}| = \\frac{37}{2} \\). Since this distance must be equal to 5, we have \\( \\frac{37}{2} = 5 \\), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the line is shifted horizontally by \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Finding the Possible Values of \\( k \\):**\n   - The distance from the center of the circle \\( 25 + 20i \\) to the line \\( \\text{Im}(z) = \\frac{3}{2} + k \\) must be equal to 5.

We can rewrite $n + 3$ as $n + 2 + 1$, so $n + 2$ divides $n + 3$ if and only if $n + 2$ divides 1. Since $n + 2$ is a positive integer, the only possible value for $n + 2$ is 1, which means $n = -1$. However, $n$ must be a positive integer, so $n = -1$ is not a valid solution.\n\nNext, let's check if $n + 2$ divides $n + 3i$. We can rewrite $n + 3i$ as $n + 2 + i$, so $n + 2$ divides $n + 3i$ if and only if $n + 2$ divides $i$. Since $n + 2$ is a positive integer, the only possible value for $n + 2$ is 1, which means $n = -1$. However, $n$ must be a positive integer, so $n = -1$ is not a valid solution.\n\nFinally, let's check if $n + 2$ divides $n - 3i$. We can rewrite $n - 3i$ as $n + 2 - 5i$, so $n + 2$ divides $n - 3i$ if and only if $n + 2$ divides $-5i$. Since $n + 2$ is a positive integer, the only possible value for $n + 2$ is 1, which means $n = -1$. However, $n$ must be a positive integer, so $n = -1$ is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive integers $n$ such that $n + 2$ divides the product $3(n + 3)(n^2 + 9)$.

The key observation here is that the points \\(D, E, F\\) are the midpoints of the sides of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), and thus the circumcircle of \\(\\triangle DEF\\) is the nine-point circle of \\(\\triangle ABC\\). The nine-point circle passes through the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments from the orthocenter to the vertices of the triangle.\n\nThe angles subtended by the arcs at the center of the circumcircle are twice the angles subtended at the circumference. Therefore, we need to find the angles subtended by the arcs at the circumference and then double them.\n\nThe angles subtended by the arcs at the circumference are:\n- \\(\\angle DEF = \\angle BAC = 84^\\circ\\)\n- \\(\\angle DFE = \\angle ABC = 60^\\circ\\)\n- \\(\\angle EDF = \\angle ACB = 36^\\circ\\)\n\nThus, the angles subtended by the arcs at the center are:\n- \\(\\angle DOE = 2 \\cdot 84^\\circ = 168^\\circ\\)\n- \\(\\angle EOF = 2 \\cdot 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\\)\n- \\(\\angle EOD = 2 \\cdot 36^\\circ = 72^\\circ\\)\n\nThe sum of these angles is:\n\\[168^\\circ + 120^\\circ + 72^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\]\n\nSince the sum of the angles around a point is \\(360^\\circ\\), the sum of the lengths of the arcs is:\n\\[168^\\circ + 2 \\cdot 120^\\circ + 3 \\cdot 72^\\circ = 168^\\circ + 240^\\circ + 216^\\circ = 624^\\circ\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{624}\n\\]"], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["exact_match"], "doc_hash": "57d1b0e924c6ea5f7abb317411ddae9f809022bdc9ed7b525d1c20ac009acb7b", "prompt_hash": "ca5b06ec6490f709903c854cdff7a5272d41c43da2b85f1e0314a670456a5a73", "target_hash": "eaa0689a095d4394a05fb51b84b0175a47f68221261377e4829444cbfcae23ca", "exact_match": 0}
